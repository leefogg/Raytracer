# Raytracer
In this project I have tried to implement a 3D raytracer that is capable of rendering promitive objects in real-time.
Raytracers are nutorious for being very intensive and ineffiecent tasks to complete - especially in real-time as the nature of the algorithm only supports one pixel at a time.
