# Raytracer
In this project I have tried to implement a 3D raytracer that is capable of rendering primitive objects (such as spheres and planes) in real-time.
Raytracers are nutorious for being very CPU intensive and ineffiecent tasks to complete - especially in real-time as the nature of the algorithm unpredictable and potentially infinitely recursive.
